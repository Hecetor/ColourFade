# ColourFade
A simple screensaver of a gradient spinning lol

This is a dumb lil project I just happened to start working on. Gonna try and implement a few things the next few months :)

## Installation
**Will provide soon.** The screensaver isn't [notarized](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20macOS%20Catalina%20and%20later%20also%20require%20software%20to%20be%20notarized%2C%20so%20that%20you%20can%20be%20confident%20that%20the%20software%20you%20run%20on%20your%20Mac%20doesn%27t%20contain%20known%20malware.%C2%A0An%20app%20that%20has%20been%20notarized%20by%20Apple%C2%A0indicates%C2%A0that%20Apple%20checked%20it%20for%20malicious%20software%20and%20none%20was%20detected.) yet, meaning that when you download the screensaver macOS may popup with a warning stating that Apple can't check it for malware. Obviously this screensaver doesn't have a virus, otherwise the source code wouldn't be on here. **<ins>There will be a short tutorial sometime soon.

Also thought I'd add that you need a `Developer ID` to notarize Apple software of any kind which costs $99 USD.
